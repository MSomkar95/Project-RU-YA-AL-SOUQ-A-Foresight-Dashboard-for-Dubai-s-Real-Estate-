- The Units (apartments) segment shows higher market clustering, with over 90% of activity captured in just 30 areas, reflecting urban density and developer-driven projects in established zones (e.g., Downtown, Business Bay, JVC, Dubai Marina).

- The Villa market is more dispersed, driven by suburban growth areas and emerging communities (e.g., Arabian Ranches, Dubai Hills, Damac Hills), appealing to families seeking space and lifestyle amenities.

- The Dubai market has consolidated around mid-segment residential units (1B/R–3B/R), reflecting maturing investor behavior and steady end-user absorption. The luxury and office segments remain stable, but smaller-unit investments are driving turnover and liquidity.

 - Rising Mortgage Share: The percentage of transactions involving mortgages has steadily increased, particularly after the 2008 financial crisis, indicating that consumers are more reliant on financing for property purchases. By 2020, the mortgage share was 79.78%, and it is forecasted to remain high (79.99%) in 2025.
 - Stable Sales Transactions: Sales transactions have seen some fluctuation, but they have remained relatively steady, with periods of higher growth in the mid-2000s and late 2010s. Sales make up a significant share of the market but are gradually being overshadowed by mortgage transactions.

- Over the last 3 years, units with parking have posted a remarkable CAGR of 43.64%, while those without parking have posted 30.83%. The 5-year CAGR is also notably higher for parking available (23.10%) vs. not available (12.75%). This signals that parking availability is a premium feature, consistently commanding higher price growth.
- The 10-year CAGR is positive for both, but higher for parking available (6.89%) than not available (2.50%). This difference illustrates an increasing market preference for properties with parking, especially in recent years.

1. Concentrate Capital in High-Liquidity Districts
2. Anchor Product Strategy Around Mid-Market Demand
3. Leverage the Mortgage-Driven Market Transition
